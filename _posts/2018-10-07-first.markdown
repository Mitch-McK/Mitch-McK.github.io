This is my first post to this blog site. Initially, I set this up as part of a tutorial in order to learn something new and occupy my time. Revisiting this half a year later, the thought crossed my mind that it might be a good opportunity to start recording a bit of the work I'm doing and show off a bit of my coding prowess (a bit of sarcasm here). 

I'm assisting with a community coding project at the moment, which has me writing more small programs. I'll try to update here when possible and most are found in this repository.

{% highlight javascript %}
let example = 'word';
function helloWord() {
  example = 'hello, world!';
}
{% endhighlight %}
