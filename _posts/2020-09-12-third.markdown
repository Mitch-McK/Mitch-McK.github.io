It's only taken, what, 2 years, to start with a second post? Hold on while I get a hang of setting this site up again. It's relatively barebones and I'd like to keep it that way.

In the meantime, check out some out a few interesting sites:

- [Center for Humane Technology](https://www.humanetech.com/)
- [The Institute for Ethical AI & Machine Learning](https://ethical.institute/)

And a few books to keep you busy:

- [Aurora](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23197269-aurora)
- [Interface](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/828.Interface)
