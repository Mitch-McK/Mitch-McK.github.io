There's nowhere I'd rather be than next to you right now
But you know what?
We have a lifetime (or two) of adventures and birthdays ahead of us
Filled with laughter and love
And camping. I promise we'll go camping.
You have my whole heart, Laurel Anne.
So today,
Eat all the cake you want
Wear sweatpants all day
It's your day and don't let anyone tell you otherwise
And it is your day after all!
"You sort of start thinking anything's possible if you've got enough nerve." -J.K.Rowling
